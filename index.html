          It is 17:50. The plane has just taken off and will take us far, very far, to where, for nearly two years, we dreamt of returning. We are barely 50 people in this big 747 which is flying to SANAA, magical city, dream city, dazzling city which will become a reality in a few hours. 86 is soon, in a few hours, in a few minutes. That’s it, we are now in 1986 and it’s champagne galore. It is barely 4 o’clock in the morning when the plane lands in SANAA. The dream, which we nurtured for so long, is there in front of us, for us. Jean is there to welcome us. Fortunately since I forgot his telephone number. It is cold in the terminal. Jean takes us to his place in his Suzuki. He went to bed late because of New Year’s Eve. But he still came to pick us up at 4 in the morning. We await daybreak at his place with
        </p>

          <p class="page-text">a glass of ??????. Jean’s house is situated behind the cinema on the border between the new and the old city. At 7 o’clock, when day breaks, we climb onto the roof. The view is amazing, infinitely more beautiful than from the roof of Sam City: we see the city bathed in a still feeble light, the minarets pointing towards the sky. The view moves me. SANAA, the most beautiful city in the world; from Jean’s house… As usual, after too long an absence, I find it difficult to regain the closeness, the intimacy which we acquired over weeks and months of a friendship woven together. I also feel an urgent need to recreate this closeness. I seek the stumbling block, the small detail that will put us back on the same path. I need this closeness. But what a strange fellow is Jean “who protects himself,” maybe because he knows me too well and he knows how far I can go with those who do not know how to protect themselves. I believe it is going to be very difficult to get something out of Jean.
        </p>

          <p class="page-text">He takes us to the Orient Hotel, situated at the end of his street. We slept just 2 hours on the plane, we are exhausted, we go back for a couple of hours’ sleep as we have to go to the tourist office to get our permits before 10 o’clock. Hey, by the way, tourists who stay for less than 1 month in Yemen don’t need anymore to go to the Ministry of the Interior to get the entry visa and exit visa. Once we get the permits, we go and respire the air of SANAA in the old city, not far from Tahrir… always as dusty. We drink the excellent tea with milk All day long. At 13:00 we have a meeting with Jean. We spend some time in the mufredj discussing this and that, hearing the latest Yemenite gossip, the latest stories about this or that issue, the quarrels between the tribes… I love to hear him.
        </p>

          <p class="page-text">(???) I greatly admire Jean for his immediate sociological understanding of events, for his need to rationalize any behavior, attitude. From his mufredj, where we are sitting, the postcard view of the old city laid out before our eyes is unique. We try to reach on the phone our friend, sheikh Abdul Quasser. His wife answers and claims that he is asleep and we should call back at 3 o’clock. We go out for lunch, in the meantime… to eat the fish we dreamt of for so long, and about which we had so many fantasies. The reality is equal to the memory: fish, feta, spicy sauce, everything is there… we taste/savor. We return to Jean’s place. We call the sheikh: he picks up the phone. Jean tells him that Myriam and Frédéric have just arrived in SANAA. He invites us to come to his place
        </p>

          <p class="page-text">in an hour. Sheikh Abdul Ouasser lives in a big house at the entrance to Babel Cho’oub . When we arrive, we find him alone sitting in his mufredj, chewing qat. Next to him, on a small low table, lies a telephone – two worlds trying to co-habitate. Sheikh Abdul Quasser tells us that he had to go to London for an operation (as the one he had done in Egypt was not successful). His brother, Abdul Quarad, has just returned from a long trip to Europe – Germany, England and France. We hear news about Beit Sinan. The women, apparently, waited for Myriam throughout the month of October; they watched all the cars that arrived in Beit Sinan. Without us asking for anything, he offers to take us tomorrow morning to Sinan – tamam !! We bid farewell to our sheikh. As we exit his house, we run into his driver.
        </p>

          <p class="page-text">Abdul Quasser will come and fetch us at the hotel tomorrow morning at 9. It is already dark when we leave the sheikh’s house, we have some errands to do. We need to buy perfume for presents as we don’t have enough. Perfume is less expensive in SANAA. Pascal comes to see us in the hotel; he is in SANAA for a UNESCO mission. We ask him about the latest Yemenite gossip. Dinner with Jean and his “doe,” fish for a change.
        </p>

          <p class="page-text">Thursday, January 2, 1986
          At 9 o’clock, on the dot, Abdul Quasser is there with his driver. We drive around the city to buy vegetables, meat, qat, before heading for Beit Sinan. After passing the first checkpoint, Abdul Quasser and his driver collect their guns from a grocery store at the edge of the road and load 2 Qabilis in the back of the car. After the asphalt road, there is the same route, nothing has changed, as dusty as ever. The landscape that presents itself, though already familiar to us, is a source of wonder. A desert landscape covered in black rock and the odd hamlet here and there. We cross the famous village where a vendetta took place 5 years ago. It seems that there was a rumpus a few months ago which left 20 dead; the sheikh told them that if they didn’t stop, he would intervene, he and his men. Everything seems to have got back to normal since then.
        </p>

          <p class="page-text">The car pushed on, we glimpsed the sheikh’s two houses, on the hill. We stop at Beit El Aifa. Abdul Quarad is sitting in a grocery store. It’s a joyful reunion. We introduce Linda. We continue to Beit Sinan. Soon it’s time for lunch. I am not at all hungry. I have barely digested the fish and the feta… and I know what awaits us… We’ll have to honor our sheikh. Resting in Abdul Wasser’s mufredj. Our photos are already majoritaire in Sinan. The photo of the three sheikhs takes pride of place in the mudredj, next to that of the ancestor. We are a little surprised by the arrival of 2 Yemenites in European dress… speaking perfect English. They are the experts in charge of drilling for water and conveying the water. They spend their time wandering up and down the country. Arhab suffers partially from dryness. After lunch, we leave with the 2 sheikhs, the “experts” and a flock of Qabilis to visit the drilling sites.
        </p>

          <p class="page-text">It’s the hour of the qat. I never saw a “qat mufredj” so full. We spend almost an hour chewing, Then we decide to go and say hello to our friends, we will return at nightfall, we want to enjoy the last rays of sunlight. Privileged moments – a trip into time – emotional reunions; loss for words, gazes, smiles, handshakes, hugs which say it all. Expectations which I feel are reciprocal. To think, it’s 2 years since we were last here. It feels like yesterday. Return to the “Diwan.” Our qat chewers are there but, since at such an hour, no one is talking, the only sound is that of the gurgling of nargilas. We sit outside the diwan, where Mursa, Abdul Quasser’s driver, is sitting with other Qabilis. We sing some French songs. Like last year, the evenings are very long, too long,
        </p>

          <p class="page-text">all the more so, as we cannot withdraw or retire to our own mufredj. We have to be present, listen to the gurglings of the nargila. We also have to bear the 11th plague, Beit Sinan’s homosexual, who sneaks into our mufredj and spends a good part of the evening in our company… which he seems to enjoy! The bastard rubs himself. At first, against me. Under the pretext that it’s cold, he lays a blanket over us and takes advantage of the situation to touch me. I dare not put him in his place, so I move to another spot. If Linda had not accompanied us, we would never have known that the man was simply a crazy fellow, “a sex friend,” who likes men, women and whatever he can lay hands on. Now, it’s Linda, whom he’s going for but she puts him in his place. When he is there, we are unable to do anything, he is so clingy – like glue.
        </p>

          <p class="page-text">We greatly looked forward to these reunions with those whom, throughout this “diary” I shall call “our friends”; and everything was wonderful. I try to identify the chronology of those moments spent with “our friends” and I scrutinize the <span class="chrono-link highlighted" id="item-42255">contact sheet number 673</span>. All we can do is follow our sheikhs into the qat mufredj. For courtesy’s sake <span class="chrono-link" id="item-42204">(shots 4-8)</span>. But we only have one thing in mind: to go and see our friends again. The path that leads to their house is not long but it is a veritable fighter’s course; any person we cross paths with could be fatal for us. Today will be our first visit after a 2 years absence and I remember well the cold welcome given to us by Salem and Amram last year; we could not spend one minute with them without the presence of an Arab. We now risked encountering the same situation as last time. Once exiting the mufredj, we have the choice of several routes. We chose to pass under the sheikh’s house as seen clearly in <span class="chrono-link" id="item-42207">photo number 9</span> taken for this purpose. The closer we get to our goal, the faster we push ahead. My anxiety is huge… How will we be received?? The welcome is undreamt of. During the first moments of our reunion, I quickly give Amram the 2 mezuzas (which he kisses), not knowing how much time we will be able to talk freely without the presence of the Arabs. Time passes and the emotion is great. These reunions are undreamt of. As sunset approaches, the mufredj is bathed In exceptional light <span class="chrono-link" id="item-42208">(shots 10 to 17)</span>. The emotion makes us forget all the questions we had prepared. We keep telling them that we are here just for them… Do they truly understand? I think their welcome is the most beautiful reply. The sun has set, we have to head back. One last photo <span class="chrono-link" id="item-42216">(18.19.20)</span>, where they make the tanurs. We leave a dream. However, we must return to reality.
        </p>

          <p class="page-text">Friday, January 3, 1986
          Waking up in Beit Sinan, always magical. From our mufredj on the top floor of the house, we see in the distance the mountain chain beyond which the kingdom of Arhab ends. Breakfast with Abdul Quasser in his mufredj. Linda’s bag has just given way under the weight of the perfumes I had filled it with. We have to find someone to repair it. We ask our sheikh who suggests we go down to the house of “AL YAOUD.” We will thus visit our friends on the advice of our friend, the sheikh, who will join us later. In all the homes here, hospitality is the number one law. It’s a blessing that Linda’s bag broke! We rush to the house of “al Yaoud” with the blessing of Abdul Wasser. When we arrive, Amram is getting ready to carry out a shechita <span class="chrono-link" id="item-42168">(contact sheet 672)</span>. The women are in the kitchen busy making bread for Shabbat. Soon, too soon, we have barely spent half an hour alone with our friends when Abdul Wasser “turns up” with a flock of Qabilis and children <span class="chrono-link" id="item-42219">(contact sheet 673, shots 21-24)</span>.
        </p>

          <p class="page-text">to join us… And soon a flock of Qabilis arrive on the premises. A blanket was brought to the sheikh so that he could sit outside, and the hide of an animal was given to him so that he would not be cold. He receives the honors due to him. He is served raisins and dates. Then we are invited into the mufredj to partake in a light meal. The sheikh makes a point of stressing that, after this, lunch will be served at his place. The dishes which are served to us are succulent. Pieces of bread dipped in butter + onion tops covered in honey – EXQUISITE. We want to buy some wicker baskets. The sheikh does not want us to spend one penny, all the more so as the Qabilis are there (outside). We return with Abdul Quasser to his place for lunch. After lunch, we spend a good part of the afternoon on the roof of the house, in front of
        </p>

          <p class="page-text">our mufredj, sunbathing in the Arhab sun. On reflection, I feel that, over the years, we slowly achieved something that resembles independence… even if we remain, here in Sinan, the attraction 2of the moment. We take advantage of the last rays of sunlight to go out and take photographs. Today, Myriam and Linda are with the women, they were invited for a qat session. I go outside to take a turn, alone, without an escort, which is rare here. The evening is going to be a long one. We go from mufredj to mufredj, Abdul Warad, the homo, doesn’t let us go for a single moment. He tries his old ploys again. We watch the TV, it’s always as amusing as ever. The ads with blue-eyed blondes and American playboys.
        </p>

        <p class="page-text">After having spent a lot of time this morning with our friends, we don’t want to be imprudent and return to see them this afternoon. To think, we are just a few meters from their house; I am sick at the thought of this but I have to be rational. What we just experienced with them was so extraordinary. Of course, we would love to welcome Shabbat with them, join them for the seuda … Maybe on our next trip… or never… or solely in my head. I forgot to mention the making of the tanurs which we witnessed, <span class="chrono-link" id="item-42417">contact sheet 676</span>.
          The color photos came out better. I find it very difficult to work in such a harsh light.
        </p>

<p class="page-text">Saturday 4 “Mursa”, the driver, knocks on the door of our mufredj to wake us up. We leave for Wadi Hared after a small breakfast in the courtyard of the house. “Allah, Allah”, I say, as I walk down the steps of the house, in case I encounter a woman. The road that leads to Wadi Hared is amazing. We glimpse Al Arjan, a big village; we cross Wadi al Meh, we see, at the far end of the wadi, Beit Hazeb. Then another village: Sira. Then Wadi Hared. The homo insisted on joining us with his son Ahmad. Wadi Hared has changed a lot. It has become a veritable camping site where the Qabilis gather together to take a dip. The water couldn’t be clearer. It’s a hot water spring. I decide to take a dip too with the Qabilis. Everyone wants to ask Mursa: who is that greenhorn? </p>

<p class="page-text">Everyone has deposited their arms, their djambia  and djellaba at the edge of the pool. After so much dust, my trousers feel rigid in the evening. I enjoy the youthful dip. Myriam and Linda watch and photograph us. Wadi Hared is an oasis in the middle of a stone desert, a forest of bulrushes where you can hear the sound of the water flowing. A “mejnun”  who seems to want to fool around with his djambia and revolver reminds us how every situation is precarious in a tribal society where force is the supreme value. We realize how the friendships we formed with important figures at the center of this tribal world are important, friendships without which we would never have been able to come – alone – to such remote areas. Here we are the protégés of Sheikh Sinan. Return to Beit Sinan, lunch with Abdul Quasser and Warad. </p>

<p class="page-text">We spend a good part of the afternoon on the balcony in the sun. Myriam and Linda are going to go and chat with the women. Abdul Quasser is chewing alone this afternoon in his mufredj. I join him late in the afternoon after having taken a stroll with Myriam and Linda before sunset… escorted by… the entire village. The evenings are not so long. We acquire, each day, more independence and manage to isolate ourselves in our mufredj. Before going to our quarters, we are shown a video film which Abdul Warad brought back from Germany. Unbelievable but true: it’s a film about Yemenite Jews in Israel. Yemenite dances, singers with a kipa on their head, the camera does not omit the Israeli public. All this is, practically, unknown in Arhab, in the mufredj of Abdul Warad surrounded by the sheikh’s family. We don’t know how to react. </p>

<p class="page-text">The afternoon is long, very long. I hesitated a long time about returning to our friends this afternoon: I have a deep desire to see them, knowing that this could be the last time we will be in Beit Sinan. How many times I gazed, through the little window (on the door of our mufredj) and through which we could see our friends’ house! How many times, on the balcony, did I gaze in the direction of their house which is just a few meters below the sheikh’s house. And to think that they waited for us for Shabbat lunch and Abdul Quasser, who knew this, never informed us. I chomp at the bit all afternoon. Fortunately Myriam is there to prevent me from going. I am dying to go there. </p>

<p class="page-text">Sunday Youm el Arad is souk  day in Beil el Aifa. We are in the courtyard at 8 as instructed by Abdul Quasser last night. Clearly, he has not yet woken up. He opens his shutters, it is 9 o’clock. “Sbah al rher!” Sbah al nur. The drivers warm up the engines of the Toyotas. A “Qabili” is slitting a lamb’s throat in the courtyard; our sheikhs are expecting today distinguished guests, also from Arhab, with whom they will leave tomorrow for a few days to sort out some problems. The souk has changed a lot, instead of a real souk, it’s a “car souk”; everyone has laid out their merchandise in front of their cars. We meet people from Sinan. We meet our friends with their children. They have come to the souk to sell the skins they prepared. They clearly have no desire to meet us in this environment which they must feel as hostile. We too do not feel at ease. Only little Yaya, Amram’s son, comes over to say hello. </p>

<p class="page-text">The souk is an opportunity for every Qabili to bring his problems to the sheikh… We have great difficulty returning to Beit Sinan. Back in Sinan. The guests are here. They have been invited into the mufredj. They are astonishingly noble. It seems that they are also sheikhs further north in ARHAB. There are 4 of them. There is one whose face I can't forget; it is so beautiful and embodies everything one imagines when one thinks of the Orient. Afterward, a long photo session: <span class="chrono-link">“The meeting of the sheikhs”</span>, following prayers, it’s time for lunch. Like every day the menu is the same, but we do not complain. We begin with “bint a sarh” followed by several plates of vegetables: zucchinis, beans, okra, sweet potato, cabbage, tomato and pepper condiments. Bread drizzled with melted butter. Meat juice. Rhilba. Meat – RLASS</p>

<p class="page-text">All this swallowed down in ¼ hour. I only have eyes for the noble face who embodies the Orient and next to whom I am seated <span class="chrono-link">(contact sheet 674 photo number 0)</span>. After the meal, we return to Abdel Quasser’s mufredj with all our sheikhs. I appreciate these moments; I know that we are in the very center of tribal life. Sheikhs visiting one another. Without even knowing well the tribal code – the little we know, we learned from Jean – I can see the importance of each person’s gestures and the place they occupy in the mufredj. There is something fascinating about the warring spirit. After we are offered tea – because those who chew qat don’t drink tea (it dissolves fats), the sheikhs take their rifles which are hanging on the wall of the mufredj and head for the diwan where the qat session is about to begin. Abdul Quasser is always very attentive and doesn't want to leave us alone; he chats a little with us. We talk again about Paris and his future trip with his</p>

<p class="page-text">
brother to visit us. I think this time it's practically certain they will come after Ramadan. Abdul Quasser prays. We leave him and go to our mufredj for a siesta… I had a lot of trouble taking leave of our sheikh on the pretense of going to our mufredj to have a siesta. We lingered 10 minutes on our terrace to make sure our sheikh was in his qat mufredj. Indeed, a few minutes after positioning ourselves on the roof – where one can see everything – we see him heading for the qat mufredj to join his brother and his guests – it’s good, we can go. Shit!!! One of the sheikh's young neighbors, who like most Qabilis has nothing to do, sees me on the terrace and calls out, “Sadik!” I answer him in the same tone; he's standing over there on the plateau above the sheikh's house. He’s not a bad fellow, the “sadik,” but he sticks!! and is oppressive. We have to wait ½ hour for him to enter his home. I think we can go now. What path should we take? Let’s hope that the iron door is open. Above all, this is not our 1st escapade; we mustn’t make any noise on the stairs. Let’s hope we don't bump into anyone, otherwise it's over… And to think they believe we are having a siesta. It’s a real obstacle course… After the stairs, we have to cross the courtyard. Luckily, no one is around and the iron door is open. I dare not look at the windows… We head straight on, our friends' house is not far away. No one seems to have seen us. Except perhaps someone behind a window whom we can't see… We hurry on. I don't want to look back. Phew, we arrive. Yaya is here, he runs to fetch his father, his uncle… and the key to the mufredj, and invites us in.
</p>

<p class="page-text">In Yemen, people go crazy over perfume. Abdul Warad sprays us with 2 or 3 different types of perfume as well as all his guests. There's even one perfume that is so greasy, it leaves huge stains. The sun has set. Myriam and Linda join the women; I go to the diwan which is bathed in smoky darkness. It's the hour when all you can hear is the gurgling noise of the “madars.” I go and sit opposite Abdul Warad, who is conversing with his sheikh guests and seems to be recounting his latest trip to Germany… and his future trip to Paris. For my part, I smoke a madar. I'm enjoying the atmosphere that reigns in the diwan at such a time. I feel good here. The smoke intoxicates me. I'm happy to be here this evening with them. I rarely had such a</p>

<p class="page-text">feeling…??? with a group of qat chewers. I feel good. When I leave, it is night, a night like I saw nowhere else, a starry night like I never dreamt of. I am going to get Myriam to share the experience. How can the sky be full of so many constellations? What a night! This day will remain unforgettable. The trip has begun well, I'm almost tempted to say, too well. Our mufredj – I didn't even talked about it, with its 2 fish hanging on the wall, its little grenade with the pin still in it next to the attaché case and the photos of Abdul Az in Iraq, as well as a photo of Abdul Wasser his father as a young sheikh.</p>

<p class="page-text">Today, Sunday, will certainly remain the most intense afternoon spent in the company of our friends… without a single Arab to disturb our intimacy; I can't help thinking about our last visit when we couldn’t even be one minute alone with them. The most intense and the richest too, photographically. Rarely on this trip has the light been so beautiful as during these late afternoons in the mufredj. My eyes were fixed on <span class="chrono-link">Salem as he spun the cotton</span> with which, later, he would make tsitsiot. And the voices of the <span class="chrono-link">children studying</span>; all of this remains unforgettable. Seeing me photographing the men studying, <span class="chrono-link">a woman goes and fetches her sewing machine so that she can be photographed in turn</span>… and shows us what she can do. I forgot to mention that we were scolded by the 4 brothers who had specially prepared a Shabbat meal for us… and who waited in vain for us. The sheikh had refrained from telling us this – in short, we had to have yesterday's meal… and liters of tea, grapes… until we exploded. Today, <span class="chrono-link">contact sheets 674-675</span>. The sun has already set, and night has begun to fall. We head back as we had promised to come to the qat mufredj. They are chewing their qat; I ruminate on all the photos I just took.
</p>

<p class="page-text">Monday, January 6
We wait and wait, constantly wait. Up early, we wait in the courtyard – the household is still asleep. The qat prevented everyone from falling asleep last night and now they can’t get up. We spend a good two hours waiting in the courtyard with the “drivers” who take good care of us. Nothing here is ever definite; we are going to learn this lesson once again. Our sheikhs, who were meant to leave today for ARHAB to visit the sheikhs who came yesterday, will only leave tomorrow. We lost nearly the entire morning. Other Qabilis have arrived in Sinan, no doubt to talk about their problems. They kill a sheep in the courtyard; it’s Abdul Quasser who kills it. There will, undoubtedly, be a big crowd at the table for lunch.</p>

<p class="page-text">It is 11. We hear the shutters opening. The homo, the old satyr, in short “the loser” – it’s the word of the day – has just appeared. As I walk around the house, and pass under a window, garbage falls on my head, because in Sinan, like everywhere in Yemen, garbage is thrown out of the window. Abdul Quasser’s leg hurts this morning. We drive to Beil el Aifa with Abdul Quasser to buy some qat. I take my tension out on a rosary which A.W. gave me. For the last 2 days, we have been treated to two enormous meals and we reach our mufredj with great difficulty. The two enormous meals were – the meal at the sheikh’s house and the meal at our friends’ place. It’s our last day in Beit Sinan and today, too, we will try to get out and see our friends. We cite, as our regular pretext, the indispensable siesta.</p>

<p class="page-text">Monday, January 7 I shoot a portrait of our Qabili… and finally he decides to leave. So we return to the mufredj and there our family presents us with the most beautiful of spectacles: that of the study. Amram, the Mori  treats us as witnesses and gazes at us as he chants the text, as though to signal us that we are one of them. <span class="chrono-link">The light dims in the mufredj</span> and there are probably just a few minutes left before sunset… And to think, I wanted so much to take a picture of the 4 brothers. I beg Amram to kindly agree and ask his brothers also to agree… Finally he agrees. Quick! Quick! Quick! I shout, just time enough to click away in black and white, then in color, and the sun has gone. (contact sheets 679-680) Just like last night, the sheikh must be waiting for us in his mufredj and we have to leave if we don’t want to arouse any suspicion. It’s time for farewells; “our friends” know that we leave tomorrow at dawn. We promise to send them mezuzot and megillot… via Jean. We would like to promise that we will return, it is our dearest wish… at Succot. Be ezrat Hashem. End.</p>
